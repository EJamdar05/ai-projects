# Artificial Intelligence (CS461) Assignments

The following repository is a selection of works done in my AI class at CSUEB. The Java assignments were worked on with partners while the LISP assignments were done solely by me. Names of the partners have been removed for privacy reasons. If you are a student of Hank Stalica's 461 class, please do not take any of this code and claim it as your own. It won't be worth it to cheat in this class and this is your disclaimer. Use this repo if you need help with his assignments: https://github.com/aimacode

## Overview of the Repo Files
* Genetic Algorithm Population
This program will take in an initial population of a group and simulate who is the best genetic offspring in the population over the generations. Uses genetic algorithms and mutation to figure this out.

* Three Wives/Husbands Problem
This program solves the three wives and three husbands problem. The problem revolves around three husbands and wives on one side of a river and to bring them all to the other side of the river without having husbands outnumbering women on either side. 

* Tic Tac Toe (4x4)
Written in LISP, this program implements a 4x4 Tic Tac Toe board using a Min-Max algorithm that tries to find the best move on the board with a depth limit (to make sure it does not search an entire tree).

* Lisp Practice
Basic LISP practice problems that helped write the Tic Tac Toe implementation in LISP.
